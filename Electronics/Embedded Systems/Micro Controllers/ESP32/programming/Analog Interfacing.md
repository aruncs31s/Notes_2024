#### Introduction

- ADC will have a defined resolution and a reference voltage which is usually the supply voltage
- Maximum Possible Value

$$
Max = 2^N -1
$$

_Where N = resolution_

- If resolution is `8 bit`

$$
Max = 255
$$

 <details>
<summary>Example</summary>
Thus, if the reference voltage is 5V and an 8âˆ’bit ADC is used, then 5V corresponds to a reading of 255, 1V corresponds to a reading of (255/5*1) = 51, 2V corresponds to a reading (255/5*2) = 102 and so on. If we had a 12 bit ADC, then 5V would correspond to a reading of 4095, 1V would correspond to a reading of (4095/5*1) = 819, and so on.

Calculate Resolution

```python
N=int(input("Enter the ADC Value"))
print("Max Value = " ,2**N -1)
```

`Credit` [Intercaing Code](https://github.com/yash-sanghvi/ESP32/blob/master/AnalogReadWithLDR/AnalogReadWithLDR.ino)

```c
const int LDR_PIN = 36;

void setup() {
   Serial.begin(9600);
   analogReadResolution(10); //default is 12. Can be set between 9-12.
}
void loop() {
   float LDR_Voltage = ((float)LDR_Reading*3.3/1023);
   Serial.print("Reading: ");Serial.print(LDR_Reading); Serial.print("\t");Serial.print("Voltage: ");Serial.println(LDR_Voltage);
}
```

#### Measure Voltage using ADC Pins

```bash

```
