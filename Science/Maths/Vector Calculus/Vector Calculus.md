#### Basics Of Vector

A scalar is a quantity that has only magnitude ,eg: `time`, `mass` , `distance` , and a ==vector is a quantity which has both magnitude and direction==, eg: `Velocity`,`force` ,`displacement`

$$
\overrightarrow A =A_{x}\hat a_{x}+A_{y}\hat a_{y}+A_{z}\hat a_{z}
$$

##### Magnitude of Vector

$$
A = | \overrightarrow A | = \sqrt{A_{x}^2+ A_{y}^2 + A_{z}^2}
$$

> [!NOTE] Basis of A vector
> $\large \hat i$, $\large \hat j$ are ==basis vectors== of $xy$ coordinate system

##### Unit Vector

It is defined as a vector whose magnitude is unity and direction is along $\vec A$ 

$$
\hat a_{A} = \frac{\overrightarrow A}{|\overrightarrow A|} = \frac{\overrightarrow A}{\overrightarrow A}
$$

$$
\overrightarrow A = A\  \hat a_{A}
$$
