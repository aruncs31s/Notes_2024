#### Serial Vs Parallel Communication

| Serial                                              | Parallel                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Over a given line or channel on bit can communicate | Multiple bits can communicate over a set of parallel lines<br> |
| Long or short distance communication                | Short Distance Communication                                   |
