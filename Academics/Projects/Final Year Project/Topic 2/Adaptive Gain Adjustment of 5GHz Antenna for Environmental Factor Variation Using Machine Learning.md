# Adaptive Gain Adjustment of 5GHz Antenna for Environmental Factor Variation Using Machine Learning

## Prerequisites:
- [[Machine Learning]]
- [[Analog and Digital Communication]]
- [[MIMO]]
- [[ESP32]]
---
## Motivation

- Wireless Communication get highly effected by environmental conditions.
- not all power transmitted will reach the receiver due to following facts
	- Attenuation
	- Destructive interference


#### Advantages of 5Ghz

- More Available channels
- Less crowded Which reduces the interference from other devices because the bluetooth also uses the 2.4Ghz so there will be less crowd in `5Ghz`
- High Bandwidth
- Lower Latency

## Objective

- develop adaptive **5GHz** antennas for wireless communication
- adaptive antenna system **that leverages machine learning techniques** to adjust its parameters dynamically in response to **changes in environmental**

## Methodology

We are trying to dynamically change its parameters to maintain signal quality

1. Design and Construction
   1. Type of Antena
   2. Modeling Software
2. Dynamic Parameter Adjustment
   1. Radiation Pattern and Beam Steering: For phased array antennas, we can dynamically control the radiation pattern by altering the phase and amplitude of the signal at each antenna element.Which requires a Micro Controller or Single Board Computer or FPGA Board.
   2. Gain And Bandwidth
   3. Impedance Matching
   4. Polarization adjustiment
3. Integration With Machine learning
   1. Planning to use sensors
   2. Control algorithm using machine learning which will decide which factor to be changed in order to get maximum output
   3. Make a feedback mechanism if possible -> which enable constant control of the parameters through the communication between the reciever and the transmitter

## Working 
### ML Involvement
1. **Predicting CSI at Receiver Side**: CSI is measured at the receiver , so in  usual communication  system the `CSI` details is send back to the transmitter ,  ==This involves significant overhead==, such as on 20-MHz channels with 64 subcarriers i.e. carrier waves that are modulated to send additional information [^2]
> Dr Zhang and his team have discovered that CSI vectors in Wi-Fi networks can be approximated by a linear combination of as few as three sinusoids
>- These findings underpin Zhangâ€™s development of CSIApx, an innovative compression methodology which offers high compression ratios with little loss of accuracy and the added advantage of low computation complexity resulting in a favourable reduction in overhead. [^2]
