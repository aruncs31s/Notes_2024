### Motivation

#### Advantages of 5Ghz

- More Available channels
- Less crowded Which reduces the interference from other devices because the bluetooth also uses the 2.4Ghz so there will be less crowd in `5Ghz`
- High Bandwidth
- Lower Latency

### Objective

- We are going to develop adaptive **==5GHz==** antennas for wireless communication
- This project focuses on designing an adaptive antenna system **that leverages machine learning techniques** to adjust its parameters dynamically in response to **changes in environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and obstacles**

### Methodology

We are trying to dynamically change its parameters to maintain signal quality

1. Design and Construction
   1. Type of Antena
   2. Modeling Software
2. Dynamic Parameter Adjustment
   1. Radiation Pattern and Beam Steering: For phased array antennas, we can dynamically control the radiation pattern by altering the phase and amplitude of the signal at each antenna element.Which requires a Micro Controller or Single Board Computer or FPGA Board.
   2. Gain And Bandwidth
   3. Impedance Matching
   4. Polarization adjustiment
3. Integration With Machine learning
   1. Planning to use sensors
   2. Control algorithm using machine learning which will decide which factor to be changed in order to get maximum output
   3. Make a feedback mechanism if possible -> which enable constant control of the parameters through the communication between the reciever and the transmitter
