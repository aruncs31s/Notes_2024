### Abstract

- Exploit existing antenna technologies to achieve **Large Array Antenna Aperture**
- Utilizes the **Co-array Concept** to provide a **large virtual array antenna**, Which achieves
  - High **BeamForming Gain**
  - High **Spatial Resolution**
- It also uses an **Angle of Arival(AOA)** to detect the **Array Antenna Phase Ambiguity**
- The performance is analyzed using **Cramer-Rao Lower Bound(CRLB)** calculation method.
- Outperforms existing planar array antennas

#need

- Increased use of **GNSS**
- Due to long range communication the **SNR** of the received signal is very low
  - so the **GNSS** can't be used indoor
- All the **GNSS** share the same freq. ->= interference

So this paper overcomes some of the existing limitations
