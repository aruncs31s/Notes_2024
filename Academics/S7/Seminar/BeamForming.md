# BeamForming
>[!blank|right-medium]
>![[BeamForming.excalidraw]]


BeamForming is a technique used in **Sensor Arrays** for directional signal transmission or reception.[^1]
- Achieved by combining the Array elements in a way that it causes **[[Interference]]**

[^1]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor_array

#advantages 
- Used to increase the **gain**
- Improves estimation performance 
- It can increase the **gain** of receiving signal in one direction and decrease in other.

##### Increasing the Antenna Gain
The BeamForming is used in antennas to increase the **directional gain** -> which increase gain in one direction and decreases in others
