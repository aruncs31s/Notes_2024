## Module 2


#### Resonator
- Used in LC and L and C circuits -> Tuned Circuits and and Oscillators, amplifiers and filters etc..
- Absorbs maximum power when the frequencies are matched -> which is used in [[|lab Experiment]] to determine the frequencies
- At tuned frequencies ($f=f_r$) the **impedance** is real.
- also at resonant frequency ($f = f_r$)
  $$
  Total \ Energy = 2 \times Energy \ Stored \ In \ Resonator
  $$

##### Cavity Resonator 
A length of waveguide (either rectangular,cylindrical or coaxial) shorted at both the ends forms a [[#Resonator]] and it is often called a **Cavity Resonator**

---

- The ==stored electric and magnetic energies inside the resonator decides the equivalent impedance and capacitance== while the ==energy dissipated due to finite conductivity of the cavity walls determine the equivalent resistance of the resonator==[^1]

- The microwave cavities resonates at discrete frequencies called **"Modes of resonance"** 
##### Q factor
The cavity resonator can be also classified according to **Q factor** or **Quality Factor**

- How much energy can it store depends on Q factor.
- Which defines the sharpness of resonance

$m,n,p$ -> No of half cycles along the direction $x,y,z$

$$
k = kx^{2}+ ky^{2}+ kz^2
