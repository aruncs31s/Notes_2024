### **Introduction**

Git is a `source control` created for the `Linux` Kernel by `Linus Torvalds`.

- Git stores data as snapshots and if file is not changed

---

### **Basics**

- [[#Kick Start]]

#### Kick Start

- To upload local folder/repo to `github`

```bash
echo "# tic_tac_toe" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/BloBuster/tic_tac_toe.git
git push -u origin main
```

- Push existing repo

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/BloBuster/tic_tac_toe.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

#### **Installation**

- Windows [Click Here](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- Debian

```bash
sudo apt install git
```

- Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install git
```

- Arch Linux

```
sudo pacman -S git
```

---

#### **Initial Setup**

This only required to do once like configuring user email and user name .

- Setting up you identity

```
git config --global user.name "You name"
git config --global user.email youremail@google.com
```

_You can exclude `--global` flag it sets this properties as global but if you want to keep repository wise configs you simply exclude that_

- You can use the following to see saved configs

```bash
git config --list
```

#### Creating a repo

```bash
gh repo create
```

#### Pushing Changes to Github

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "added <this File>" # Change this accrdingly
git push origin main
```

#### Dropping Commits

Consider if you added your password file in you commit accidentally(like i did once) and want to delete that `commit history` from git

1. **Identity the commit**

```bash
git log
```

2. **Start interactive Rebase**

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~x
```

_where x is the no. of commits back_ 3. **Use `drop` to drop the commit**

```
drop xyz123123
```

save the file and exit 4.

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

5.

```bash
git push origin <branch name>
```

##### Deleting the most recent commit

1. **Delete it from local**

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

2. Force push to remote

```bash
git push origin <branch_name> --force
```

- [[Merge Conflict]]

#### Merge Conflict

```bash
git log --merge 
```

The `git log --merge` command helps to produce the list of commits that are causing the conflict

```bash
git diff
```

To identify state of repocitories or files

```bash
git checkout 
```

The git checkout command is used to undo the changes made to the file, or for changing branches.

```bash
git merge --abort
```

Cancels the merge and return back to origina state before merge was started

```bash
git reset
```

#### Creating a new branch with an existing branch files

1. First, ensure you're on the main branch:

```bash
git checkout main
```

2. Then, create a new branch `obsidian_files_back` from the current state of the `obsidian` branch:

```bash
git checkout -b obsidian_files_back obsidian
```

This command creates a new branch named `obsidian_files_back` starting from the current state of the `obsidian` branch. All the contents present in the obsidian branch will be copied to this new branch.

3. Now, you can push this new branch to your remote repository if needed:

```bash
git push origin obsidian_files_back
```

This will push the new branch obsidian_files_back to your remote repository, making it available to others if you're collaborating on this repository

#### Deleting A branch

1. locally

```bash
git branch -d branch_name
```

2. Remotely

```bash
git push origin --delete branch_name
```

#### Git Stash

````bash
git stash list
``GCEK_Weather_Station`
GCEK_Weather_Station
- To show the `stashes`

```bash
git stash show <stash index>
````

```bash
git stash pop
```

```bash
git stash drop
```

```bash
git stash apply
```

### Advanced

##### aliasing

```bash
git config --global alias.staash 'stash --all'
```

#example

```bash
git config --global alias.po 'push origin main'
```

> [!floating|right-medium]
> we can also use `!script name.sh` instead of the normal git command

#example

```bash
git config --global alias.something !some_script.sh
```

#### Blame

```bash
git blame -L x_1,x_2
```

git blame of specific lines where x_1 , x_2 indicating seperate lines

```bash
git blame -w -C -C -C
```

- ignore white spaces
- detect lines moved or copied in the same commit
- commit that created the file
- any commit at all.

#### Duplicating a repo

```bash
git clone --bare https://github.com/aruncs31s/<old_repo_link>
gh create repo
cd old_repo
git push --mirror https://github.com/aruncs31s/<New_repo>
```
