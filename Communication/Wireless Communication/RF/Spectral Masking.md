# Spectral Masking
Spectral mask -> Channel Mask -> Transmission Mask 
Intended to reduce adjacent channel interference by limiting excessive radiation at frequencies beyond the required bandwidth 
That is power should be concentrated around the desired frequency and should get attenuated or power should be reduced for the adjacent frequencies. 
#advantages 
- Reduces Near-Far Problem

#example 
An FM radio station must attenuate everything beyond $±75kHz$ from the center frequency by a few decibels, and anything beyond ±100 kHz (the channel boundary) by much more. Emissions on further adjacent channels must be reduced to almost zero[^1]
