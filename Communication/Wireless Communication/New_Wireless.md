# New Wireless Technologies

- According to Counterpoint's reasearch `30 billion` WiFi devices shipped between 1999-2019 -> 20 years
- But in recent 2 years alone `10 billion` devices shipped

**Growing Demand For**:

- Faster throughputs
- Higher bandwidth

#### How **5G+WiFi** Doing it .

- Network slicing

- [ ] Qos(Quality of Service)

##### WiFi 7

- Higher order `QAM`-> to pack more bits within a carrier
- Multi-user MIMO -> To boost Signal to noise ratio.
- Multi-RU OFDMA -> to reduce interference and latency
