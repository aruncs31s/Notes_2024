#### An Introduction to Adaptive QAM Modulation Schemes for Known and Predicted Channels

- Adaptive Modulation -> can be used in [Final Year Project](Academics/Projects/Final%20Year%20Project/Final%20Year%20Project.md)

##### Adaptive Modulation

**It is a technique used to change the modulation scheme based on the channel conditions. Which enhances the reliability of data transmission over varying channel conditions.**

- Dynamic Adjustment: Adjusts the modulation scheme based on the channel conditions.
- Improved Spectral Efficiency
- Constant Bit Error Rate (BER)
