##### Adaptive Modulation

**It is a technique used to change the modulation scheme based on the channel conditions. Which enhances the reliability of data transmission over varying channel conditions.**

- Dynamic Adjustment: Adjusts the modulation scheme based on the channel conditions.
- Improved Spectral Efficiency
- Constant Bit Error Rate (BER)

**Here the modulation scheme is changed based on the channel conditions**. The modulation scheme is changed based on the **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)** of the channel.
Also the receiver should also know the change in modulation scheme in order to decode the information.

- This paper mainly focus on error performance and spectral efficiency of **Adaptive Modulation** Schemes.
