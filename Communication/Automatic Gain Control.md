**Automatic Gain Control(AGC)** *is a closed-loop* feedback regulating circuit in an **amplifier** or 
- to maintain a suitable signal amplitude at its output, despite variations in the amplitude of the input signal.
- It is used in **radio receivers**, **televisions**, **wireless communications**, and **recording systems**.
- The AGC circuit adjusts the gain of the amplifier to maintain the output signal level at a constant level.



- [x] what does it do ? âœ… 2024-09-28

- It is a `closed-loop` feedback circuit which helps to maintain a constant output irrespective of the input variations
- The basic elements of **AGC** are `detector`, `control circuit` and `gain amplifier`
